# Objective

Tectonic correlation is investigated by `ObsPy` module.

# Locations

Temporal and spectral correlations are investigated between some seismic stations from strategic locations around the globe.

# Time window

Investigation time window a few hours before and after the following earthquake event:

> A powerful 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck off the northeastern coast of Japan on December 8, 2025, at 11:15 p.m. local time (1415 GMT), with its epicenter located 80 km (50 miles) off the coast of Aomori Prefecture at a depth of 50 km.
