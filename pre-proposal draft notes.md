## Research questions

Algorithmic trading firms are smashing wall street trading records [@natarajan2025jane]. They are able to do so by forecasting financial market prices. They are involved with any market like currencies, commodities, stocks, bonds, cryptocurrencies, and more.

The trading algorithms are so effective that they have sparked lawsuits and disputes over their ownership [@bloomberg2024jane].

Effective prediction for structural and earthquake engineering can save human lives. Therefore, as structural and earthquake engineers, it might be fair to have these questions in mind:

* Why does algorithmic trading look generally so effective at forecasting market prices? There are always edge case, of course.
* Can structural and earthquake engineering learn from financial forecasting?
* If so, what can structural and earthquake engineering learn from the financial forecasting?

## Humans vs nature

The above questions are specially noteworthy, considering the fact that the financial behavior is affected by human psychology which is extremely hard to predict. However, structural and earthquake engineers are dealing with natural phenomena which are expected to follow specific natural rules, hence are expected to be more predictable.

## Motivation

There is motivation to answer the above questions. Since there are curious similarities between financial and structural systems:

* They both boil down to partial differential equations or PDEs
* They both deal with some stochastic phenomena
* Extreme events like market crash and structural collapse
* External physical forces and forces of market buyers and sellers
* Similar patterns of stress buildup and sudden release
* Structural energy and market momentum
* Structural vibrations and market fluctuations
* Equilibrium of physical forces and market supply and demand
* Shock propagation through the financial network and structures
* Thresholds of financial tipping points and structural buckling
* Structural health monitoring and market surveillance
* ...

## The other way around

The book "The Physics of Wall Street" by James Owen Weatherall mentions a geophysicist who used a model designed for earthquakes to predict a massive stock market crash [@weatherall2013]. Also, it discusses about a physicist-run hedge fund that earned `2478.6%` over the course of the 1990s.

Structural engineers rarely dive into finance, but when they do, they might at times make a real impact, like Didier Sornette [@sornette_wiki].

Financial industry has been using physical models to effectively figure out the financial behavior. But now, can it be the other way around? Can structural engineers learn from financial industry?

## Long-term vs short-term

* Short-term phenomena:
   * High frequency trading
   * Realtime structural vibration prediction
   * Earthquake forecasting
* Long-term phenomena:
   * Options pricing
   * Portfolio management
   * Structural health monitoring

## Feasibility

Financial data is abundantly available both historically and real-time. There are benchmark structural sensor data and earthquake timeseries available, but not as massive as financial data.

The trading algorithms are proprietary and there is no access to them. Unless we develop our own algorithms.

## Hypothesis

* Maybe the abundance of financial data makes it easier to predict in the short term?
* Possibly, prediction effectiveness correlates with data availability
* Would it make sense to develop synthetic structural data by simulations?
* Maybe the market prediction itself affects the market, it means prediction changes the system
* ...

## Notice

The interdisciplinary topic is a high-risk, high-reward research.

## Impact

Just like the concept of _target market_ for startup ideas, our research idea will have a practical impact. Just like the startups who seek larger target markets, our research can aim for a large practical impact. Larger practical impact might indicate higher research effect on the society overall.

## Structural forecasting

To streamline the iterative design process, deep learning is already combined with traditional FEM [@carvalho2024iterative]. The aim has been to iteratively design a truss without re-simulating the whole structure on every iteration. Therefore, the truss behavior is forecasted rather than simulated. Its theoretical basis is upon another research on neural network architecture and the calculation procedures [@Hozhabrossadati2020]. Its practical impact is to propose a more efficient truss design procedure for structural design community.

Can we find a topic with a higher practical impact within structural engineering field? I mean, a target audience larger than the structural design community.

## Earthquake probabilistic forecasting

While deterministic earthquake forecasting might be impossible, probabilistic earthquake forecasting is being actively pursued, as described by a paper published on Nature [@beroza2021machine].

Earthquake forecasting is practically validated by a 30-week real-time field testing which combines Big Data with AI [@saad2023earthquake]. Therefore, continuous probabilistic earthquake forecasting is shown to be quite feasible.

Feeds from global seismic stations might be employed for short-term (hours to days) probabilistic forecasting. The big data analytics and machine learning are prospective tools to be used.

Earthquake probabilistic forecasting has a noticeable practical impact. It would provide early warning systems for large metropolitan cities with historic seismic disasters. It could potentially affect the human society as a whole.

### Problem with earthquake probabilistic forecasting

The problem is that earthquake forecasting lies more within the geophysics field. It might be far away from earthquake engineering, let alone the structural engineering field.

## General options

There are a few general options available:

* Structural control
* Seismic hazard forecasting
* Structural damage forecasting
* Structural behavior forecasting
* Earthquake emergency exit plan
* ...

Preliminary investigations could be done to find a limited and doable topic for the PhD program.
