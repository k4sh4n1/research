## Abstract

Financial markets exhibit stochastic behaviors similar to structural engineering systems e.g. oscillation, shock response, and collapse. Nonetheless the sophisticated mathematical toolkit developed for structural systems remains largely unapplied to financial analysis. This research proposes a systematic investigation for applying structural engineering methodologies — probably those derived from structural health monitoring, structural control, and finite element modeling - into quantitative finance. With algorithmic trading now comprising `92%` of market volume and foreign-exchange being a `$7.5` trillion-a-day market in 2022 and a `$9.6` trillion-a-day market in 2025, even marginal improvements in prediction accuracy could provide significant economic impact. Preliminary results by proof-of-concept implementations on financial timeseries are revealing patterns and insights not visible by traditional financial tools. This multidisciplinary approach could provide opportunities for market understanding, risk management, and algorithmic trading strategy development.

## Research philosophy and motivation

Structural systems and financial markets share foundational similarities:

* Stochastic behavior under external forces
   * Financial forces of buyers against sellers or bulls against bears
   * Stochastic nature of seismic loads and financial shocks
* Extreme events
   * Structural collapse
   * Market crashes
* Characteristic frequency and damping behavior
* Need for real-time monitoring and anomaly detection
   * Structural health monitoring or SHM
   * Market surveillance
* Forensic similarities
   * Structural forensic analysis involves investigation and inspection of structures
   * Technical analysis involves study of past market data for forecasting price direction
* Support and resistance terminology for both structures and price action
* Similar patterns of stress buildup and sudden release
* Structural energy and market momentum
* Similarities between structural vibrations and market fluctuations
* Equilibrium concept
   * Structural forces
   * Supply and demand across macro and micro economy
* Financial friction and mechanical one
* Nonlinear dynamics behavior
* Shock propagation through the financial network and structural network
* Thresholds
   * Financial tipping points
   * Structural buckling
* ...

For example, when a trader follows the price action methodology, it feels like they are telling a story of bulls and bears. The story of how price momentum is shaped by buyers and sellers. This story-telling remarkably resembles how external forces are exerted upon a physical body to determine its momentum and behavior.

Despite the similarities, the rich structural toolkit remains mostly unexplored in quantitative finance. This gap presents opportunities for practical innovation for:

* Theoretical contributions to econophysics
* Novel predictive tools based on physical systems theory
* Improved understanding of financial markets through physical systems

## Related work

The book "The Physics of Wall Street" by James Owen Weatherall mentions a geophysicist who used a model designed for earthquakes to predict a massive stock market crash [1]. Also, it discusses about a physicist-run hedge fund that earned `2478.6%` over the course of the 1990s. Financial industry has been using physical models to effectively figure out the financial behavior. There are some academic studies carried out, but systematic investigation of structural methodologies remains mostly absent.

## Literature gap

The literature review reveals several critical gaps. While physics-inspired approaches to financial markets have gained traction, the specific application of structural engineering methodologies remains underexplored.

The rich mathematical frameworks available for structural hazard analysis, structural health monitoring, structural control, and finite element method, have seen minimal systematic application. Although econophysics has applied concepts from mechanics and thermodynamics to financial markets [2] [3].

Some recent studies have investigated the impact of global news events on major equity and bond markets through the lens of seismology, but without leveraging the full toolkit of structural engineering [4].

There is no comprehensive framework mapping structural parameters, including mass, stiffness, damping, to financial variables in a systematic way. The few attempts that exist focus on specific phenomena rather than developing a general theoretical framework [5].

Traditional financial analysis relies on Fourier transforms and wavelet analysis [6]. However, the specific advantages of modal decomposition for identifying market regimes and predicting transitions remain unexplored. Modal analysis is a prominent tool of structural dynamics used to identify natural frequencies and mode shapes. It can be systematically applied to decompose financial time series.

The finite element method or FEM has revolutionized structural engineering. FEM application to financial risk modeling is virtually non-existent. Discretizing the market into elements and analyzing stress distribution by FEM represents a significant potential opportunity.

The literature review reveals a huge gap in cross-domain expertise. Financial experts generally lack the knowledge of physical systems, and structural engineers rarely dive into finance. Exceptions like Didier Sornette [7] have indicated the potential, but systematic investigation remains absent.

Structural health monitoring or SHM, which is able to detect structural damage in real-time, is parallel to market surveillance and crash prediction. However, no comprehensive framework exists for adapting SHM methodologies to financial markets.

Market crashes are equivalent to structural failures, however the sophisticated mathematical tools for analyzing shock response in structures, including response spectra, time-history analysis, and stochastic dynamic analysis, have not been systematically adapted for financial shock events. Some studies have been carried out but they see the problem from a network model perspective not the dynamic response characteristics central to structural analysis [8].

In structural engineering the physical experiments would validate theoretical models. Frameworks for validating structural models against market data can extend to both back-testing and real-time testing. The performance metrics could be specifically developed for physics-based trading strategies. The literature lacks frameworks for validating physics-based financial models against market data. This gap presents an opportunity for academic and practical innovation. Considering the increasing dominance of algorithmic trading, there is a need for novel validated forecasting in financial markets.

## Preliminary results

As a proof-of-concept, an MQL5 code on platform MetaTrader5 is developed. Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT) approach is employed to carry out the frequency spectrum analysis. HHT is particularly useful for non-linear and non-stationary signals. HHT is commonly applied to seismic signals, here HHT is applied to financial timeseries.

Some specifics of the proof-of-concept test:

* HHT and FFT methods are implemented to analyze the price data
* Currency: EUR/USD pair
* Timeframe: M1 or 1-minutes bars
* Real-time testing is done by a demo account on MetaTrader platform
* Data points analyzed: 200, it is an adjustable input parameter, therefore it's trivial to change

Dominant periods and cycles are identified and visualized on the chart. Sample results on Oct. 9, 2025 around 6:37 PM local time:

* Main periods:
   * 3.0 bars or 3 minutes
   * 9.2 bars or 9.2 minutes
   * 14.3 bars or 14.3 minutes
   * 20.0 bars or 20.0 minutes
   * 23.0 bars or 23.0 minutes
* Frequencies (cycles/bar):
   * 0.3378
   * 0.1088
   * 0.0700
   * 0.0500
   * 0.0435

The preliminary results indicate that systematic investigation could contribute multidisciplinary innovations inspired by structural dynamics into financial market analysis. Novel contributions to both theory and practice are highly probable.
