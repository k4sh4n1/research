The following is a draft about a research proposal authored by kashani@alum.sharif.edu

# Cross domain investigation: applying structural dynamics theory to financial market prediction and risk assessment

## Motivation

Structural systems and financial markets share foundational similarities:

* Dynamic behavior under external forces
* Extreme events, structural collapse equivalent of market crashes
* Characteristic frequency and damping behavior
* Need for real-time monitoring and anomaly detection
* ...

Despite the similarities, the rich structural dynamics toolkit remains mostly un-explored in quantitative finance. This gap presents opportunities for practical innovation for:

* Theoretical contributions to econophysics
* Novel predictive tools based on physical systems theory
* Improved understanding of financial markets through physical systems

TODO: reference work of seismic scientist in predicting crash.

There are studies done already, but systematic investigation of structural dynamics remains absent.

## Background

The author's educational and industrial background is:

* Civil engineering, BSc
* Earthquake engineering, MSc
* Structural engineering, MSc
* 10+ years of professional software development by C++, Go, Python, JS, C#, and more
* Experience with algorithm development

This multidisciplinary background would enable to:

* Investigate mathematical similarities between physical and financial systems
* Implement efficient algorithms
* Innovate theoretical toolkits for practical applications

## Significance

This research could have high significance impact due to:

* Significant academic gap between engineering fields and quantitative finance
   * Lack of enough multidisciplinary researchers in both fields
* Significant trading volume of financial markets
   * Currency market alone has had a `$7.5` trillion _daily_ volume in 2022 [3]
   * `92%` of trading is done by algorithms and computers in 2019 [4]

## Research questions

This research proposal would try to answer these questions, at least:

* Can structural dynamics methods identify specific characteristics of financial markets?
* Can structural dynamics methods help with financial timeseries forecasting?
* Can structural dynamics methods predict market crashes?
* Can structural dynamics methods detect market regime changes?
* How do structural dynamics methods apply to financial markets?

## Research methodology

The following plan can be outlined.

* Stage 1: picking structural dynamic methods
   * Investigate correspondence between physical and financial systems
   * Outline mathematical mapping between physical and financial systems
* Stage 2: applying structural dynamic methods to financial markets
   * Novel mathematical framework development
   * C++ and Python implementation on MetaTrader platform
   * Optimization
* Stage 3: validation and testing
   * Back-testing with multiple decades of historic market data
   * Live testing on demo trading accounts

For stage 1, the structural dynamics methods to be candidate for investigation are listed as follows, but they are not limited to this list.

* Modal analysis
* Natural frequency detection
* Spectral analysis
* Fourier transform
* Structural health monitoring methods
* Damping ratio
* Finite element analysis, FEA
* ...

## Expected contributions

Scientific contributions:

* Novel systematic application of structural dynamics into finance
* New class of theoretical models for market behavior
* Mathematical framework bridging physical and financial systems

Practical contributions:

* Improved market prediction algorithms
* Novel trading signal generation methods
* Innovative risk detection tools

## Timeline

A rough timeline might be outlined as follows.

* Year 1: literature review, investigating methods to adopt
* Year 2: mathematical framework development for methods
* Year 3: implementation and validation
* Year 4: optimization and dissertation writing

## Preliminary results

Some MQL code on MetaTrader platform are developed. The preliminary results indicate that systematic investigation could contribute novel multidisciplinary innovations inspired by structural engineering into financial market analysis.
