# Cross-domain timeseries forecasting: from engineering to finance

## Motivation

Both structural response and market price are timeseries

## Background

I have civil, earthquake, and structural engineering education along with extensive software development experience.

Understanding structural behavior can provide intuition for understanding financial market behavior.

## Proposed research

The structural analysis methodologies are adapted to financial data.

## Preliminary result

A simple example of using ? analysis on stock prices will be presented.

## Expected contribution

New class of models for financial market analysis will be presented. The model validation can be done by:

* Back-testing using historic market data
* Online testing using real-time market data

The new models will be applied to practical trading of financial markets.

## Disclaimer

There is no guarantee that this research won't fail.
