# Objective

The objective is to understand the _reinforcement learning_ or RL by implementing the codes of the RL book. 

# RL book

# Code

Code for this section of the RL book is implemented:

> 3.2. Understanding Markov Property from Stock Price Examples

Our code is available here:

# Markov process: logistic function

The code results are presented here.
