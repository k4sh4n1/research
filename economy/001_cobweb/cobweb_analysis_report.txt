COBWEB MODEL ANALYSIS - COFFEE MARKET
======================================================================

1. DATA SUMMARY
   - Product: Coffee (Arabica)
   - Total Observations: 426
   - Date Range: 1990-01-01 00:00:00 to 2025-06-01 00:00:00
   - Mean Price: ¢ 144.91/lb
   - Std Dev: ¢ 65.46/lb
   - Min/Max: ¢ 50.83 / $409.52

2. ESTIMATED DIFFERENCE EQUATION
   P_t = 1.1803 + (0.9965) × P_{t-1}

   Interpretation:
   - β₀ = (c + a)/b = 1.1803 (constant term)
   - β₁ = -d/b = 0.9965 (autoregressive coefficient)

3. MODEL PERFORMANCE
   - R² = 0.9695 (97.0% variance explained)
   - RMSE = 11.4095
   - This indicates good forecasting power

4. STABILITY ANALYSIS
   - |β₁| = 0.9965
   - Model is: CONVERGENT
   - Interpretation: Prices will converge to equilibrium

5. LONG-RUN EQUILIBRIUM
   - P* = β₀/(1-β₁) = ¢ 338.02/lb
   - Current price: ¢ 363.16/lb
   - Distance from equilibrium: ¢ 25.14

6. THREE-PERIOD FORECASTS
   t+1: ¢ 363.07/lb
   t+2: ¢ 362.99/lb
   t+3: ¢ 362.90/lb

7. FORECASTING POWER ASSESSMENT
   ✓ The model explains 97.0% of price variation
   ✓ Good predictive accuracy
   ✓ Stable dynamics suggest reliable forecasts

8. ECONOMIC INTERPRETATION
   - Supply elasticity (d): Negative (as expected)
   - Demand elasticity (b): Determines price sensitivity
   - The cobweb pattern may be weak
   - Agricultural production lag is captured by P_{t-1} term
