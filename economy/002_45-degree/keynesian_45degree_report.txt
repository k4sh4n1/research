45-DEGREE KEYNESIAN MODEL ANALYSIS - US GDP
================================================================================

1. DATA SUMMARY
   - Economic Variable: Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
   - Source: FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)
   - Total Observations: 314 quarters
   - Date Range: 1947-01-01 to 2025-04-01
   - Time Span: 78.2 years

   GDP Statistics (in Trillions of 2017 Dollars):
   - Mean: $10.24T
   - Std Dev: $6.29T
   - Min/Max: $2.17T / $23.77T
   - Latest GDP: $23.77T

2. SIMPLE KEYNESIAN MODEL SPECIFICATION

   Theoretical Foundation:
   The simple Keynesian model with consumption function:

   Y_t = C_t + I + G + NX
   C_t = α + β × Y_{t-1}

   This yields the difference equation:
   Y_t = α + β × Y_{t-1} + ε_t

3. ESTIMATED PARAMETERS

   Estimated Equation:
   Y_t = 0.0223 + 1.0046 × Y_{t-1}

   Parameter Interpretation:
   - α (Autonomous Expenditure) = $0.0223 trillion
     → Represents I + G + NX (investment, govt spending, net exports)

   - β (Marginal Propensity to Consume) = 1.0046
     → Out of each additional dollar of income, 100.46¢ is consumed
     → Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS) = -0.0046

4. MODEL PERFORMANCE & FORECASTING POWER

   In-Sample Fit:
   - R² = 0.9994 (99.94% of variance explained)
   - RMSE = $0.1474 trillion
   - MAE = $0.0628 trillion
   - MAPE = 0.70%
   - Assessment: Excellent forecasting power

   Forecast Error Analysis:
   - Mean Error: $-0.0000T (bias check)
   - Mean Absolute Error: $0.0628T
   - Standard Deviation: $0.1474T
   - Max Absolute Error: $1.7483T
   - MAPE: 0.70%

   Out-of-Sample Validation (Last 47 quarters):
   - Test R² = 0.9600
   - Test RMSE = $0.3422T
   - Test MAPE = 0.71%
   - Conclusion: Stable and reliable

5. DYNAMIC MULTIPLIER ANALYSIS ⭐

   Short-Run Multiplier (k₀):
   k = 1/(1-β) = 1/(1-1.0046) = -218.5987

   Economic Interpretation:
   → A $1 increase in autonomous expenditure (I, G, or NX) leads to
     a $-218.5987 increase in GDP in the long run

   → If government spending increases by $100 billion, GDP will eventually
     increase by $-21.86 trillion

   Multiplier Path (First 10 Quarters):
   Quarter 0.0: Impact = 1.0000, Cumulative = 1.0000
   Quarter 1.0: Impact = 1.0046, Cumulative = 2.0046
   Quarter 2.0: Impact = 1.0092, Cumulative = 3.0137
   Quarter 3.0: Impact = 1.0138, Cumulative = 4.0275
   Quarter 4.0: Impact = 1.0184, Cumulative = 5.0460
   Quarter 5.0: Impact = 1.0231, Cumulative = 6.0690
   Quarter 6.0: Impact = 1.0278, Cumulative = 7.0968
   Quarter 7.0: Impact = 1.0325, Cumulative = 8.1293
   Quarter 8.0: Impact = 1.0372, Cumulative = 9.1665
   Quarter 9.0: Impact = 1.0419, Cumulative = 10.2084

   Convergence: ✗ Divergent dynamics
   Speed: Slow (β = 1.0046)

6. GDP FORECASTING (Y_t) - 8 QUARTERS AHEAD

   Last Observed GDP: $23.77T (as of 2025-04-01)

   Forecast Equation: Y_{t+k} = 0.0223 + 1.0046 × Y_{t+k-1}

   Quarterly Forecasts:
    t+1 (Q1): $  23.90T
    t+2 (Q2): $  24.03T
    t+3 (Q3): $  24.17T
    t+4 (Q4): $  24.30T
    t+5 (Q5): $  24.43T
    t+6 (Q6): $  24.57T
    t+7 (Q7): $  24.70T
    t+8 (Q8): $  24.84T

   Long-Run Equilibrium GDP:
   Y* = α/(1-β) = $-4.88T

   Current vs Equilibrium: $+28.66T
   → GDP is currently above equilibrium

7. STABILITY & CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS

   Stability Condition: |β| < 1
   - |β| = 1.0046
   - Status: ✗ UNSTABLE
   - Interpretation: GDP will diverge

   Half-Life (time to close 50% of gap to equilibrium):
   - h = ln(0.5)/ln(β) ≈ 151.9 quarters
   - This means it takes about 151.9 quarters to close half
     the distance to equilibrium

8. ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS

   ✓ The model captures 99.9% of GDP dynamics
   ✓ Marginal propensity to consume is 1.005 (realistic for US economy)
   ✓ The multiplier effect amplifies fiscal policy by -218.60x
   ✓ Strong predictive power for policy analysis
   ✓ Forecast errors are relatively small (0.70% MAPE)

9. POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS

   Based on the multiplier analysis:
   - Fiscal stimulus has a multiplier of -218.60
   - Each $1 trillion in government spending increases GDP by $-218.60T
   - Tax cuts (affecting disposable income) have similar multiplier effects
   - The economy shows instability and responds predictably to shocks
