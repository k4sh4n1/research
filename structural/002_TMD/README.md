# Implications

* El Centro is far-field, has broader frequency content, longer duration
   * TMD is more effective
   * TMDs are most effective for harmonic or narrow-band excitations
* Tabas has impulsive, near-fault characteristics
   * TMD is less effective
   * TMDs are less effective for impulsive ground motions
   * Impulsive nature of Tabas continues to challenge the TMD
   * Mass ratio alone doesn’t solve the limitation of TMDs for near-fault records
