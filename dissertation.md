## Introduction

The book "physics of wall street" quotes Warren Buffett saying: 

> Beware of geeks bearing formulas

It's a reference to the famous statement about the Trojan horse History:

> Beware of Greeks bearing gifts

Some investors might not be interested in algorithms. Also some traders believe that price is king and they don't use mathematical indicators much. Like Al Brooks the best-selling writer about price action methodology for trading.

However, trading firms like HRT, XTX, and Jane Street have been making billions of dollars by formulas and algorithms. Their founders are not only geeks, but also in some cases hippie geeks, as reported by Bloomberg.

## Price action

Price action is a trading methodology that is specially attractive. Since it is just focused on one criterion: price. Only price is analyzed without considering any other factor. Price is king, so to speak. The simplicity of involved parameters makes price action ideal for systematic investigation and application of structural dynamics.

On the other hand, it is safe to say that structural dynamics is also reduced to remarkable simplicity in professional engineering practice. For example the earthquake design response spectrum of ASCE 7 standard [1] assumes the whole building as a single degree-of-freedom (DOF) mass-spring system. By just having the period of this single DOF system, you can get the corresponding spectral response acceleration in terms of acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^2).

It is tempting for us to investigate and apply the simple practical concepts of structural dynamics into price action methodology. Price action resembles a story-telling about the two forces: bulls and bears. So, there are two dynamic forces being exerted on the system simultaneously: buyers and sellers.

## Structural health monitoring (SHM)

SHM installs sensors all around the structure to measure its responses. By analyzing the sensor signals, the structural characteristics are inferred. Based on structural characteristics, it is judged whether there is any structural anomaly.
