# Cross domain investigation: applying structural dynamics theory to financial market prediction and risk assessment

## Terminology and notation

PA: Price action methodology

SHM: Structural health monitoring

DOF: Degrees of freedom

## Algorithmic trading

The book "physics of wall street" quotes Warren Buffett saying: 

> Beware of geeks bearing formulas

It's a reference to the famous statement about the Trojan horse History:

> Beware of Greeks bearing gifts

Some investors might not be interested in algorithms. Also some traders believe that price is king and they don't use mathematical indicators much. Like Al Brooks the best-selling writer about price action methodology for trading.

However, trading firms like HRT, XTX, and Jane Street have been making billions of dollars by formulas and algorithms. Their founders are not only geeks, but also in some cases hippie geeks, as reported by Bloomberg.

## Target market

Any market can be tried out, including stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities, options, futures, and more. Both local venues and global ones can be tried out.

## Fundamental vs technical

There is a distinct difference between fundamental analysis and technical one. Fundamental analysis is used extensively by long-term investors and institutions. Technical analysis is extensively used by short-term traders.

There are two parts to this research:

* Fundamental analysis
* Technical analysis

## Price action

Requires deep understanding of price behavior


Price action is a trading methodology that is specially attractive. Since it is just focused on one criterion: price. Only price is analyzed without considering any other factor. Price is king, so to speak. The simplicity of involved parameters makes price action ideal for systematic investigation and application of structural dynamics.

On the other hand, it is safe to say that structural dynamics is also reduced to remarkable simplicity in professional engineering practice. For example the earthquake design response spectrum of ASCE 7 standard [1] assumes the whole building as a single degree-of-freedom (DOF) mass-spring system. By just having the period of this single DOF system, you can get the corresponding spectral response acceleration in terms of acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^2).

It is tempting for us to investigate and apply the simple practical concepts of structural dynamics into price action methodology. Price action resembles a story-telling about the two forces: bulls and bears. So, there are two dynamic forces being exerted on the system simultaneously: buyers and sellers.

## NEoWave

NEoWave is an improved version of Elliott wave theory [2]. It is more objective than the Elliot and has been effective in predicting recent markets.

## Structural health monitoring (SHM)

SHM employs sensors installed around the structure to measure its responses. By analyzing the sensor signals, the structural characteristics are inferred. Based on structural characteristics, it is judged whether there is any structural anomaly.

What price action methodology does is very similar to SHM. Price action tries to analyze timeseries for prediction. Technical analysis is basically to determine the market characteristics. The rigorous mathematical tools of SHM might be brought to financial economics to investigate their effectiveness for price forecasting.

## Structural control

Structural control tries to interfere with structure by various means to control its response to prevent it from becoming unstable. 

Financial institutions might benefit from structural control concepts since they are interested in controlling markets to avoid crash.

## Market fractals and wave patterns

NeoWave can be considered as an evolution of Elliott Wave Theory. Some derivations of NeoWave has been extremely effective in real-time trading. Can we apply mathematical tools of structural dynamics to fractal and wave theory in order to provide a physics-based objective perspective?

## Partial differential equations or PDE

Physical phenomena can be described as PDEs. Market price can be described by PDEs taking into account the buying and selling pressures or forces.

A PDE can be fitted into the recent market price timeseries, then it can be used to forecast the immediate future. Just like how a function is approximated by Taylor series around a specific point. The Taylor series are accurate near the specific point, but their accuracy decreases farther away from the point. Function derivatives are used by Taylor series. Function derivatives estimate the local behavior of the function around that specific point, but not its global behavior.
