The following is a brainstorm about a research proposal.

# Time series forecasting

## Objective

Bazaar of Tabriz is described as the largest covered bazaar in the world and is one of the oldest bazaars in the Middle East [1]. Tabriz has been a hub for trade over the centuries and millennia. Nowadays, a huge segment of modern trade is done on financial markets. Regarding daily trading volume, by far the largest financial market is the FX or foreign exchange market or currency market [2]. FX average daily trading volume is `$7.5` trillion per day as of April 2022 according to Bank for International Settlements (BIS) [3]. FX has indicated consistent growth of daily volumes, increasing from `$5.3` trillion in 2013 to `$7.5` trillion in 2022. FX operates 24 hours a day, 5 days a week. It's the most liquid market globally dominated by the US Dollar (`88.5%` of all transactions) followed by Euro (`30.5%`), Japanese Yen (`16.7%`), and Pound Sterling (`12.9%`).

About `92%` of FX trading was performed by trading algorithms instead of humans in 2019 [4]. While algorithmic trading provides speed and execution, it is still difficult to acquire and implement. Therefore, only a handful of influential traders can acquire such sophisticated trading algorithms [4]. Implementation difficulty of effective FX trading algorithms might be due to being multi-disciplinary. It requires knowledge from multiple fields such as software development, mathematics, financial economics, and more.

Tabriz and specifically University of Tabriz can be a hub for algorithmic FX trading. Considering the available talent pool for science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and the historic background of Tabriz in trade, it's an attractive idea for University of Tabriz to work on FX trading strategies and algorithms.

## Revenue generation

Having developed an effective FX trading algorithm, the revenue generation is almost guaranteed. There are proprietary trading firms or so called _prop firms_ both globally and locally. They provide capital access for FX traders while taking a share of the final trading profit. It means, once funded, there is no need to risk capital. They use professional trading platforms like MetaTrader 5 with capabilities to develop algorithmic trading robots. University of Tabriz and its researchers can obtain risk-free profits through the global or even local _prop firms_.
