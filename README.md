The following is a brainstorm about a research proposal.

# Timeseries forecasting

## Objective

Bazaar of Tabriz is described as the largest covered bazaar in the world and is one of the oldest bazaars in the Middle East [1]. Tabriz has been a hub for trade over the centuries and millennia. Nowadays, a huge segment of modern trade is done on financial markets. Regarding daily trading volume, by far the largest financial market is the FX or foreign exchange market or currency market [2]. FX average daily trading volume is `$7.5` trillion per day as of April 2022 according to Bank for International Settlements (BIS) [3]. FX has indicated consistent growth of daily volumes, increasing from `$5.3` trillion in 2013 to `$7.5` trillion in 2022. FX operates 24 hours a day, 5 days a week. It's the most liquid market globally dominated by the US Dollar (`88.5%` of all transactions) followed by Euro (`30.5%`), Japanese Yen (`16.7%`), and Pound Sterling (`12.9%`).

About `92%` of FX trading was performed by trading algorithms instead of humans in 2019 [4]. While algorithmic trading provides speed and execution, it is still difficult to acquire and implement. Therefore, only a handful of influential traders can acquire such sophisticated trading algorithms [4]. Implementation difficulty of effective FX trading algorithms might be due to being multi-disciplinary. It requires knowledge from multiple fields such as software development, mathematics, financial economics, and more.

Tabriz and specifically University of Tabriz can be a hub for algorithmic FX trading. Considering the available talent pool for science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and the historic background of Tabriz in trade, it's an attractive idea for University of Tabriz to work on FX trading strategies and algorithms.

## Revenue

Having developed an effective FX trading algorithm, the revenue generation is almost guaranteed. There are proprietary trading firms or so called _prop firms_ both globally and locally. They provide capital access for FX traders while taking a share of the final trading profit. It means, once funded, there is no need to risk capital. Prop firms use professional trading platforms like MetaTrader with capabilities to develop algorithmic trading robots. University of Tabriz and its researchers can obtain risk-free profits through the proprietary trading by global or even local prop firms [5].

## Validation

The theoretical and methodological contributions can easily be tested by historic FX data or by demo accounts using real-time market data. Specifically, the MetaTrader platform provides convenient tools for back-testing with historic data or testing in real-time.

## Development

Code development can be done on MetaTrader platform. The programming language can be MQL which is similar to C++. Alternatively, the Python API of MetaTrader can be employed. The author has already developed multiple preliminary trading robots in MQL programming language.

## Timeseries

The FX data are essentially timeseries. Just like the seismic waves or structural responses. An effective FX trading algorithm should correctly forecast timeseries, at least most of the time. Forecasting FX timeseries would be beneficial for predicting seismic waves and structural responses over time.

This research can be defined in two stages. The first stage would be related to FX timeseries and the second stage would be related to seismic and structural timeseries.

## Competition

Many institutions around the world have departments for quantitative strategies involved with sophisticated algorithmic trading. One firm with roots in academia is Hudson River Trading (HRT) [6] that is specifically noticeable since it is founded in 2002 by Harvard and MIT graduates. HRT has profited around $1 billion in a volatile first quarter in 2021 [7]. It is different from high-frequency trading (HFT) firms since its average holding time is about five minutes as opposed to the sub-second times of HFT firms. HRT team is composed of mathematicians, computer scientists, statisticians, physicists, and engineers.

Another company rooted in the academia is XTX which is founded by a PhD holder [8]. XTX uses machine learning technology to produce price forecasts across equities, fixed income, currencies, commodities and crypto. XTX uses those forecasts to trade on exchanges and alternative trading venues [9]. Teams across XTX include researchers, developers and technologists with backgrounds in pure math, programming, physics, computer science and machine learning [9]. Such a diverse expertise can be gradually obtained according to our growth rate by tapping into the talent pool available at University of Tabriz.

## Requirements

When it comes to timeseries forecasting, the statistics and probability would become critical fields. The software development in Python language would be needed for R&D and testing. The C++ language would be needed to develop the production code. Financial economics would play a key role. It's required to understand how the financial markets behave. Down the road, machine learning and other recent popular technologies would be needed to compete on the global stage.

## Entrepreneurship

This research feels just like building a business based on science. The scientific contributions would directly affect the amount of revenue that the business would generate. The entrepreneurial spirit of the research would make it much exciting.
